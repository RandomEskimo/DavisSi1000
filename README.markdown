# DavisSi1000 - Firmware for SiLabs Si1000 ISM radios for Davis ISS weather protocol

This firmware is based upon the SiK telemetry radio firmware from
http://github.com/tridge/SiK

It implements the receiving side of the Davis ISS 900MHz wireless
weather protocol. This will allow a 3DR telemetry radio to be
used as a USB enabled Davis weather console.
